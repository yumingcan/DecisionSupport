Description:
This is a tool based on the Chinese traditional philosophy I Ching to help us make timely decisions when faced with difficult choices.

Purpose and Principle:
Chinese traditional philosophy I Ching has advantages in inspiring people in decision-making. However, it requires a series of complex preparations to generate a random hexagram in the traditional way, which limits its use. To figure out this problem, we abstracted the random process from the I Ching and implemented it in Python.

User Guide:
1.	Prepare the book I Ching.
2.	Run this code and then get one hexagram.
3.	Refer to the I Ching to get the explanation of this hexagram, which may be helpful for you to make a timely decision.
